            <h2>Aerospace Engineer</h2>
            <p><b>Nambi Narayanan</b>(born 12 December 1941) is an Indian aerospace scientist who worked for the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and contributed significantly to the Indian space program by developing the Vikas rocket engine. He led the team which acquired technology from the French for the Vikas engine used in the first Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) that India launched. As a senior official at the ISRO, he was in charge of the cryogenics division. If he was not wrongly arrested then Indian space program would be much ahead than present as he is the founder of cryogenics technology which propels the recent Chandrayaan missions. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan, India's third-highest civilian award, in March 2019.</p>
